## [Unreleased] — Milestone 1

### Added
- Project documentation: README, ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP, FEATURES, CHANGELOG, DEVELOPMENT, DECISIONS,
  M1 test checklist.
- pnpm monorepo with strict TypeScript and Vitest.
- `math-core`: canonical presentation AST.
- `math-latex`: tolerant LaTeX parser with positioned diagnostics, and serializer with a structural
  round-trip guarantee.
- `math-omml`: AST → OMML writer; Style Profiles (Word default, tuned; font and vector variants).
- `ooxml`: content controls, Flat OPC packages for `InsertXML`, `.docx` builder with custom XML
  registry, short base62 IDs and the `mb1|block|instance` tag format.
- 32 reference equations from calculus, linear algebra, ODEs, mechanics, orbital mechanics,
  control and physics, used by tests and spike documents.
- `pnpm spike:docx`: generates five Word test documents for the style comparison and
  content-control persistence tests.
- Desktop app (Tauri 2, React, MathLive): editor workspace, LaTeX diagnostics, command palette,
  inspector, themes, resizable panels, Send to Word.
- Word connector: COM add-in for Word 2016+ with ribbon tab, self-test equation, named-pipe client,
  single-step undo insertion, double-click detection; per-user install scripts.
- `connector-protocol`: JSON-RPC protocol v1 between app and connector.
- GitHub Actions: tests on Linux; Windows build of the installer and connector.

### Added (M2, in progress)
- Auto-update of the app (signed updates from the "Latest test build" release) and automatic
  installation/update of the Word add-in by the app (D-014). Builds are versioned 0.1.<build>.
- Symbol palette with top (MathType-style) and side layouts, quick access, recents, topic tabs and
  meaning search; all items available in the command palette.

### Fixed
- Equation wrapper no longer draws a second box around Word's equation (D-013).
- Structure buttons (vector, dot, hat…) now insert a typeable slot, and wrap the selection when there is one.
- MathLive placeholders are parsed as empty slots instead of unknown commands.
- Connector install on user profiles whose name contains a space (CodeBase must not be URL-escaped).

### Changed
- Default math font: Latin Modern Math (D-013).
- Word connector implemented as a plain COM add-in instead of VSTO (D-011).
