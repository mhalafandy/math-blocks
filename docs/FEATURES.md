# Features

Legend: ✅ done · 🚧 in progress · 📋 planned · 🐞 known bug

## Implemented

| Feature | Since | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ Canonical equation AST | M1 | 20 node kinds, JSON-serialisable |
| ✅ LaTeX parser with diagnostics | M1 | Fractions, scripts, primes, roots, ∑∏∫∬∭∮∯, limits placement, functions (sin…lim, `\operatorname`), `\left…\middle…\right`, accents, fonts (`\mathbf`, `\mathrm`, `\mathbb`…), `\text`, spaces, binomials, over/under braces, `\overset`, `\boxed`, tensor prescripts, matrices (6 kinds), `cases`, `aligned`/`align*`/`gathered`/`split`. Unknown commands kept as raw. |
| ✅ LaTeX serializer | M1 | Normalised output; structural round trip guaranteed |
| ✅ OMML writer | M1 | Native Word equations for every AST node, inline and display |
| ✅ Style Profiles | M1 | Math font, matrix/derivation spacing, vectors as arrows or bold |
| ✅ Word packaging | M1 | Content controls, Flat OPC for `InsertXML`, `.docx` builder, registry custom XML |
| ✅ Equation IDs and tags | M1 | `mb1\|block\|instance` |
| ✅ Spike documents | M1 | 5 style variants in `fixtures/spike/` |

## In progress

| Feature | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 🚧 Tauri desktop shell | M1 |
| 🚧 VSTO Word connector skeleton | M1 |
| 🚧 Windows CI build | M1 |

## Planned

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for milestones. Highlights: MathLive visual editor, LaTeX mode with
completion, command palette, library on SQLite, linked blocks, parameterized templates, symbol search
by meaning, numbering/references, MathType migration, precision mode, dependency manager.

## Known limitations

- OMML cannot draw column rules in matrices (`\hline`, `|c|c|` are ignored).
- Negative space `\!` has no OMML equivalent and is dropped.
- Several different `\middle` delimiters in one group: only the first is used (warning shown).
- `\color`, font sizes and `\newcommand` are not supported yet.

## Known bugs

None recorded yet.
